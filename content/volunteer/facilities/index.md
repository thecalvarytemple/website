Calvary Temple's beautiful home hosts many ministries throughout the week in addition to Sundays. The Facilities Team maintains a clean, functional, and welcoming environment for us to gather in. As projects arise, both simple repairs and larger scale jobs, we contribute our time and talent to get the work done.
