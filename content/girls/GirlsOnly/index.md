Girls Only Club gives girls a place to grow in God. Discussion-oriented units include women in ministry, college and career, truth, dating, pro-life vs. pro-choice, and attitude. Six-lesson units are complemented with projects and Adventures. Completion of unit requirements and Bible reading make a girl eligible to be a Girls Only Graduate.
