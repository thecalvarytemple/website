<h2 class="tight-header">Wednesday Nights 7pm</h2>

<br>
<br>

WE LOVE STUDENTS! We are determined to provide a place for teenagers to connect with God, other students, and older committed leaders who are dedicated to seeing them grow closer to Christ. It's a safe place to learn about Jesus, make some life-long friends, and of course, have fun.

On Wednesdays at 7pm, middle school and high school students combine for crazy games and an interactive message about Jesus! We meet in our SANCTUARY, which is big enough for your kids to bring all their friends.  

Bottom line, we want students to feel like part of the family... because they are! Students aren't the next generation to come. They are the generation of here and now, and we want to love, invest, and point them to Jesus.
