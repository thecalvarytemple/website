Friends Club provides discussion-oriented lessons to continue the Titus 2 principle of women mentoring young girls. Topics of study include the sanctity of life, accountability, commitment to Christ, life-controlling problems, purity, and choices. Units are made up of six lessons. Projects and Adventures add to each unit. The completion of unit requirements and Bible reading make a girl eligible to be a Friends Graduate.
